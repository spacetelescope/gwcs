Clean up internal code flow so that the entire GWCS Native API follows common code
paths. This enables the Native API to properly handle various forms of inputs in
a consistent manner so that evaluation and inverse have the same input handling
behavior. This means HLO and quantities should function properly as they are passed
into these portions of the Native API.

Also allows for quantities to be passed into the "low-level APE 14 API" without
raising errors.
