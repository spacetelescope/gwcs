Remove ability to use ``str`` as a frame when initializing a GWCS ``WCS``. This
is theoretically a breaking change, but the only practical impacts should be felt
on test code that was relying on this behavior for convenience.

The rational for this change is to ensure that the metadata provided by frames
is always available to the WCS. This makes the entire WCS a more robust object.

Note that we still sort of support this but only when reading from an ASDF file.
In that case, a clear warning is issued that will indicate that the WCS will not
be fully functional until the frame is properly replaced with an actual coordinate
frame object.
