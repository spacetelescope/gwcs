Fix two bugs in the ``LabelMapperConverter``:

   1. When roundtripping a ``LabelMapperArray``, with a non-default number
      of ``inputs``, deserialization fails because the init of the
      ``LabelMapperArray`` will set the number of inputs in the model to the
      default value of 2, which is then attempted to be overridden by later
      deseriaization methods.

   2. The converter fails when ``lazy_load`` is set to false and the
      ``mapper`` is an array.

Both of these issues have been resolved.
