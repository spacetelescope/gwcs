Update the ``init`` for the ``WCS`` so that it requires either:

   - All of ``input_frame``, ``output_frame``, and ``forward_transform`` to
     be properly provided.

   - The ``forward_transform`` provided in the form of a "pipeline", i.e., a
     list of tuples of (frame name or CoordinateFrame, transform (or None
     for the final step)).

This is a breaking change due to the fact that before one could make
``input_frame`` and/or ``forward_transform`` optional (``None``). Now they
are required so that the WCS has a well-defined place to lookup the
metadata for handing the input/output values to the WCS.
