   GWCS - Generalized World Coordinate System
   ==========================================


Generalized World Coordinate System (GWCS) is an Astropy affiliated package
providing tools for managing the World Coordinate System of astronomical data.

GWCS takes a general approach to the problem of expressing transformations between
pixel and world coordinates. It supports a data model which includes the entire
transformation pipeline from input coordinates (detector by default) to world
coordinates. It is tightly integrated with Astropy.

- Transforms are instances of ``astropy.Model``. They can be chained, joined or
  combined with arithmetic operators using the flexible framework of
  compound models in ``astropy.modeling``.
- Celestial coordinates are instances of ``astropy.SkyCoord`` and are transformed
  to other standard celestial frames using ``astropy.coordinates``.
- Time coordinates are represented by ``astropy.Time`` and can be further manipulated
  using the tools in ``astropy.time``
- Spectral coordinates are ``astropy.Quantity`` objects and can be converted to other
  units using the tools in ``astropy.units``.

For complete features and usage examples see the documentation site:

http://gwcs.readthedocs.org

Note
----

GWCS supports only Python 3.
