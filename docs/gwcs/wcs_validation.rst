WCS validation
==============


The WCS is validated when an object is read in or written to a file.
However, this happens transparently to the end user and knowing
the details of the validation machinery is not necessary to use or
construct a WCS object.

GWCS uses the `Advanced Scientific Data Format <https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ (ASDF)
to validate the transforms, coordinate frames and the overall WCS object structure.
ASDF makes use of abstract data type
definitions called ``schemas``. The serialization and deserialization happens
in classes, referred to as ``tags``. Most of the transform schemas live in the
``asdf-standard`` package while most of the transform tags live in ``astropy``.
`gwcs schemas <http://asdf-wcs-schemas.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ are
available for the WCS object, coordinate frames and some WCS specific
transforms.

Packages using GWCS may create their own transforms and schemas and register
them as an ``Asdf Extension``. If those are of general use, it is recommended
they be included in astropy.
