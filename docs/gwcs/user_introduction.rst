Using Generalized World Coordinate System Models
================================================

Brief Introduction and Outline
------------------------------

`GWCS (Generalized World Coordinate System) <https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs>`__ 
package is intended as a generalization of the FITS WCS standards, which basically provides
a transformation from detector array coordinates to sky, spectral, time or any other physical
coordinates, and the converse: from the physical coordinates to the corresponding detector
array coordinates. While simple in principle, it can be a complex subject. The main focus
of this documentation is first the user, who only needs to know how to use GWCS objects,
but doesn't care about the complexities or the internals of how they work, nor the justification
for this new standard. Those interested in those internals or the motiviations for GWCS 
will find this material in later sections.

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

- User Perspective: How to use GWCS models, usually packaged with the data.
- Saving and reading GWCS models.
- Developer Perspective: How to create and modify GWCS models.
- Motivation: Why GWCS was developed and how it is a large improvement over FITS WCS.

User Perspective
----------------

As mentioned, the focus here is on using GWCS models provided by others, most likely, models
that are packaged with the data they apply to.

Terminology and Conventions
...........................

To use WCS models (of any kind, FITS or GWCS) it is important to understand the terminology 
and conventions, particularly with regard to pixel coordinates. For example, are the pixel
coordinates 0 or 1 based? That is, is the first pixel identified as 0 or 1? GWCS assumes 0 
(whereas FITS assumes 1; do not confuse the two!). However, like FITS, integer pixel values 
are presumed to refer to the center of the pixel. So for GWCS, the boundaries of the first 
pixel are at -0.5 and +0.5 for all dimensions (typically 2).

The greatest source of confusion
will likely be the the presumed order of pixel coordinates. There are two main 
conventions for ordering pixel coordinates. In the context of
2-dimensional imaging data/arrays, one can either think of the pixel coordinates
as traditional Cartesian coordinates (which we call ``x`` and ``y`` here), which
are usually given with the horizontal coordinate (``x``) first, and the vertical
coordinate (``y``) second, meaning that pixel coordinates would be given as
``(x, y)``. Alternatively, one can give the coordinates by first giving the row
in the data, then the column, i.e. ``(row, column)``. While the former is a more
common convention when e.g. plotting (think for example of the Matplotlib
``scatter(x, y)`` method), the latter is the convention used when accessing
values from e.g. Numpy arrays that represent images (``image[row, column]``).

The GWCS object assumes Cartesian order ``(x, y)``, however it should be mentioned
that there is an Astropy common API for both GWCS and FITS WCS that can use
either ordering. The details regarding the common API will be found later. It may
or may not be relevant one's needs.

Installing GWCS
...............

Simple Image Use
................

This section will illustrate using the GWCS object packaged with the image data
in an ASDF file to perform conversions from pixel coordinates to world coordinates
and visa versa. The following image wcs is intended for use with a 1000 by 1000
pixel image. This is a comparatively simple WCS model for illustration purposes,
that has been constructed to have its reference pixel (500, 500) corresponding 
to ra, dec of (30, 45) in degrees.

That is all there is to it. Almost.

Use with Spectra
................

GWCS models in cases of spectral data are generally more involved, partly because
not all pixels in the detector array have a valid mapping to actual world coordinates,
and partly due to the many forms spectral data may take. We will start with the simplest
and then to more complex cases.

Some discussion of typical past approaches to spectral WCS issues is useful. Most 
astronomers may not even associate WCS with spectral data. For 1-d spectra, the most
common approach is to provide an array of wavelengths corresponding to the spectrum.
And this only after the spectrum has been extracted. All the WCS issues are buried in
calibration software that figure out the trace along which to extract the pixels and
the 2-d dispersion function to assign the wavelengths.

With more complex spectral cases, much the same thing happens. All the transformation
information is intricately bound to software to manage the resampling of the data.
This approach has been widely accepted, without much consideration of alternate 
approaches. With GWCS, the transforms are made explicit (not that you have to look
at the details if you don't wish!) and bound with the data. This permits modifications
and tweaks to these models without having to rerun the software to recalibrate the
wavelenths. Towards the end of the User section there will be a fuller description
of the advantages of this approach.

For the following cases examples are provided. The GWCS models for each example 
are contained in a corresponding ASDF file. In general, many of these GWCS models
are simpler than would be found in a real instrument, and are intened to illustrate
the principle being discussed. For the most part, one does not need to look at
the details of the underlying GWCS model. The focus is on how they may be used.

Simple Slit Case
................

Generally speaking, a slit will disperse a very narrow rectangular region of the sky
(perhaps with some distortion) onto a a roughly rectanglular region of an imaging 
detector (usually more distorted in its outline). In this simple case it is presumed
that one is interested mapping the pixels within the dispersed region into corresponding
world coordinates. Mapping pixels outside of a dispersed region is nonsensical, of course.

Typically the transform takes 2 input pixel coordinates and produces 3 world coordinates, 
RA, Dec, and wavelength.

This particular example is taken from a real JWST case, but made simpler in that both
the WCS model and corresponding data have been extracted from a much larger and complex
data set and placed into a small ASDF file. In particular, this data is part of a
Multi Object Spectrograph (MOS) mode observation using the NIRSPEC instrument. The 
extracted data are extracted from a dataset containing many extracted subimages of
the original exposure, where each subimage is effectively the smallest array that
contains the full spectrum from the corresponding "slitlet" used for that spectrum.
The example ASDF file contains the subarray data and the corresponding GWCS model
cooresponding to that subarray.

Because the spectrum of the slitlet is not perfectly rectangular in the raw data,
the subarray that contains it also contains pixels with no spectrum. Those pixels
will not have a valid WCS transformation; for those pixels, the WCS transformation
will yield NaN values. In fact, one way to determine the pixels that would have 
flux in the spectrum is to perform the transformation on all pixels in the subarray;
those without NaN values comprise the area that the spectrum is dispersed onto.

The data in this example does not have any interesting features. It is provided 
mainly to indicate the boundaries for the spectrum in pixels.

Again, we have to be careful about the order of coordinates. The GCS transformation
expects coordinates in x, y order, opposite of the Python numpy convention for 
pixel coordinates.

Well, to within 0.005 pixel in y, and 0.27 pixel in x.



Many Slit Case
..............

This usually is an extension of the simple slit case, except that in cases where many
slits or apertures are possible there are mechanisms in GWCS to handle these more 
conveniently. Rather than have an individual GWCS model for each slit, or fiber location,
it usually is the case that there is a general dispersion transformation that has the
slit location as one of its parameters. That is to say, one can make the two coordinates
of the slit location (at the slit focal plane) as two extra coordinates in the transform.
This results in a mapping that takes image x, y pixel locations as well as slit locations
m, n. These 4 values map to an Ra, Dec and wavelength. In performing the inverse mapping,
it is necessary to supply the m, n values to uniquely identify the corresponding x, y 
pixel location. Actually, the representation in the file for the GWCS for each slit or
fiber may be more involved (such as the case for JWST MSA data). An example for that
will be deferred until more GWCS features are discussed.

Integral Field Units
....................

In this case, nearly all of the spatial points on the sky within a small region are dispersed
onto an image dectector in a manner where each point is dispersed to a different region of
the detector with no ambiguity of mapping an image coordinate to Ra, Dec, and wavelength.
The optics in this case result in a discontinous transform. That is, there are small changes in
pixel location that may result in a substantially large change in RA, Dec, and wavelenth.
Handling this results in a more complex form of a transform function that is capable of 
mapping different regions of the image to different transforms. To the user, most of this
machinery is hidden and the user does not need to worry about it when dealing with
unresampled data. After resampling, the GWCS model is simpler as it usually results
in a data cube where two dimenions are associated with the spatial dimensions and the
third dimension is wavelength.

[xxx examples]

Slitless Spectroscopy
.....................

This is often the most complex case since there is no clear mapping withtout supplying
extra information, usually the 0 order location of the source in the detector array, or
related information. Even with this, most pixels in the detector array will not be valid
for a given 0 order location. A specific 0-order location maps to a continuous set of 
pixel locations in the detector, with a corresponding wavelength for each of the pixels.
So one can use a general transformation function that takes the 0 order location and a 
wavelength, to obtain the corresponding pixel, and that can be used to extract a spectrum.
Working in the reverse direction is more involved. A given pixel location may map to
a continuous line of 0-order locations that disperse light onto that pixel. The trick
is to develop a representation for that transformation that is straightforward to use.
In particular, most 0-order locations (e.g., a 2-d coordinate) will not result in a
valid transform for a given pixel.

One solution, and the most common to date, is to start with a known 0-order location,
and map that to a set of detector pixels along with the corresponding wavelenth values.
This does mean generating a GWCS model for each source, and there may be many such sources,
leading to bundling a large number of GWCS models with the original, calibrated image.
But it is also possible to build a single model that takes 3 world coordinates, the RA, Dec,
and wavelength of the source and map that into the corresponding detector x, y location.
Given a list of all the source RA, Dec coordinates, the same GWCS model can generate
the pixels and corresponding wavelengths for those pixels.

[xxx example]

Using Extra Coordinates to Generalize Transforms
................................................

GWCS permits adding extra coordinates to the transform for various purposes to
generalize the transform. A simple example for spectroscopy is the fact that
more than one spectral order may appear on the detector. The transformation
of course differs depending on the spectral order. If the transformation accepts
the spectal order as one of its input coordinates, it is possible to provide
a single GWCS model that handles multiple orders.

[xxx example]

Another spectral generalization is accomodating location of a source within the slit
with regard to the direction of dispersion. Typically WCS models presume the source 
is in the center of the slit, yet if it is known that the source is not in the center,
a more accurate dispersion relation can be obtained. Thus adding as a coordinate, the
offset of the source relative to the center of the slit width allows for handling
this issue without recomputing new GWCS models.

[xxx example]

The MSA (Multi Shutter Array) case for JWST allows reconfiguring the slit openings
for an array of
configurable slits. In principle one GWCS transformation can be constructed
to handle all possible slit locations to avoid duplicating GWCS models for each
opened slit. In this case two extra coordinates are made part of the transform,
namely the i, j locations of the slit array positions. Specify i, j, and wavelength,
and the transform provides the corresponding detector x, y (implicitly the i, j map
to spatial coordinates).

xxx example]

Narrowing General Transforms
............................

In the previous subsection the topic of extra coordinates to handle more general
transform cases was introduced. Taking the MSA case in particular, how do we
simplify the GWCS model for a given open slit without requiring the user to
supply the corresponding i, j location explicitly? There is a tool called 
`fix_inputs` that generates a new GWCS model where this method allows specifying
one or more input coordinates to a specific value, essentially removing one or
more coordinates from the transformation. For the MOS case, a specific GWCS can
be provided for each open slit, without copying the complex internals of the
transformation for each specific case. The output file has n open slit GWCS
models saved, but each one is compact, effectively saying use the general
transform, with the slit indices specified to be a given i, j. There is only
one complex transform in the file, and several definitions leveraged off of that
single model that take very little space to define.

This same tool can be used for slitless modes (e.g., specifying 0-order locations
for each identified source), or a specified spectral order.


Modifying Transforms / Using Intermediate Frames
................................................

GWCS models are usually transparent. They consist of a pipeline of transforms
between between the starting frame (usually detector coordinates), and the final
frame, sky coordinates or spectral coordinates or a combination. In more complex
there may be intermediate frames (e.g., the slit plane for spectrographs). The
transform for each step in the pipeline is usually comprised of an assembly of
simpler transforms (i.e., Astropy compound models). These may include translations,
scaling, or rotation of coordinates, distortions, and other manipulations of
coordinate values. It is
possible to modify constituent transforms (e.g., change parameters for transforms),
replace transforms. It is also possible to extract a sub pipeline of transforms
if one wants to compute the coordinates of an intermediate frame.

But such uses require understanding how GWCS objects are constructed, and is
not covered in this User section. Please read the developer section to undrestand
the details of how to construct and modify GWCS objects.

Notes about Performance
.......................

There is a comparatively high overhead to evaluating the GWCS model since it 
is comprised of an expression of all underlying transfor models. This overhead
is most noticeable when only computing the transformation for one point. If many
points should be transformed, if at all possible, transform all points in one
call to the GWCS model by passing the points as arrays rather than looping over
individual points. Doing thousands at a time essentially renders the overhead
insignificant. 

One case that is more difficult to handle this way is if the transformation is
needed for a dynamically changing cursor position for an interactive display.
There is a useful technique for addressing this, but it is discussed in xxx.

Saving and Reading GWCS Objects
...............................

The primary motivation for GWCS is the ability to save and recover GWCS models
from a data file. FITS does not provide the necessary tools to do that in any
standard way. The Advanced Science Data Format (ASDF) format was created 
in large part to be able to store
GWCS objects. Even for JWST, which is required to provide FITS products, the GWCS
objects are stored in ASDF fromat within a FITS extension. Support for storing
GWCS objects is intrinsically part of the GWCS package, which registers its
ASDF extension with ASDF when installed. In other words, when GWCS is installed,
ASDF understands how to save and recover GWCS objects. (xxx insert reference
to ASDF). The structure of an ASDF file can be considered as a dictionary (technically,
including lists as well) where the "keys" are attributes of the nested dictionaries.
If a value of any of these attributes is an GWCS object, it will be converted
into a form that ASDF knows how to save in the file, and upon reading, the
corresponding information will be turned back into a GWCS object in Python 
(Note that ASDF is language neutral, and implementations in other languages
should be able to construct equivalent objects for GWCS in that languages though
none yet exist).

The following example illustrates how easily this can be done

[xxx]

Currently the only format that GWCS supports currently is ASDF. If other formats develop
the needed capabilities to support it, we may add support for those.

JWST currently embeds GWCS information in FITS files as an ASDF FITS extension.

Motivations for GWCS
--------------------

This section is for those that are interested in why GWCS is necessary, or, 
in other words, what is wrong with the FITS WCS standard?

The mapping from ‘pixel’ coordinates to corresponding ‘real-world’ coordinates
(e.g. celestial coordinates, spectral wavelength) is crucial to relating
astronomical data to the phenomena they describe. Images and other types of
data often come encoded with information that describes this mapping – this is
referred to as the ‘World Coordinate System’ or WCS. The term WCS is often used
to refer specifically to the most widely used 'FITS implementation of WCS', but
here unless specified WCS refers to the broader concept of relating pixel ⟷
world. (See the discussion in `APE14
<https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE14.rst#backgroundterminology>`__
for more on this topic).

The FITS WCS standard, currently the most widely used method of encoding WCS in
data, describes a set of required FITS header keywords and allowed values that
describe how pixel ⟷ world transformations should be done. This current
paradigm of encoding data with only instructions on how to relate pixel to
world, separate from the transformation machinery itself, has several
limitations:

* Limited flexibility. WCS keywords and their values are rigidly defined so that
  the instructions are unambiguous. This places limitations on, for example,
  describing geometric distortion in images since only a handful of distortion
  models are defined in the FITS standard (and therefore can be encoded in FITS
  headers as WCS information).
* Separation of data from transformation pipelines. The machinery that
  transforms pixel ⟷ world does not exist along side the data – there is merely
  a roadmap for how one *would* do the transformation. External packages and
  libraries (e.g wcslib, or its Python interface astropy.wcs) must be written
  to interpret the instructions and execute the transformation. These libraries
  don’t allow easy access to coordinate frames along the course of the full
  pixel to world transformation pipeline. Additionally, since these libraries
  can only interpret FITS WCS information, any custom ‘WCS’ definitions outside
  of FITS require the user to write their own transformation pipelines.
  Furthermore, any custom 'WCS' definitions will not be handled by any WCS
  library that only supports the FITS WCS standard, thus requiring anyone
  that wishes to use it to obtain a custom library.
* Incompatibility with varying file formats. New file formats that are becoming
  more widely used in place of FITS to store astronomical data, like the ASDF
  format, also require a method of encoding WCS information. FITS WCS and the
  accompanying libraries are adapted for FITS only. A more flexible interface
  would be agnostic to file type, as long as the necessary information is
  present.
* Even handling custom WCS elements within the FITS format is made awkward 
  by FITS limitations in keyword, values and general file organization. All
  these factors caused considerable complications for HST data. A concrete
  example will be detailed below.

HST WCS Headaches
.................

Some HST data have the ability to measure positions very accurately. For example
ACS imaging data reveals that it can detect systematic position errors down to 
the 0.003 pixel level. Distortion models for ACS were able obtain 0.01 pixel
accuracy, but this could not be achieved with standard FITS WCS models. This
was partly because the distortion model consisted of 3 different distortion
elements: a 2-d polynomial distortion model; a residual grid-based distortion
correction; and a discontinuous distortion offset due to chip region slight
misalignments. The polynomial model could be handled by a widely accepted
SIP distortion model, but since the FITS WCS model has no provision for 
combining multiple distortion elements, STScI had to construct a model not
consistent with the FITS WCS standard, and not supported by any other library.

But it was worse than that. Two of these distortions required data be stored
in two extensions. And then we were asked to make multiple versions of the
WCS models available within the same file. The multiple versions of keywords,
and extensions became a bookkeeping nightmare. The solution was yet another
variance from the FITS standard, which was to place each WCS model as a
FITS file stored within a FITS extension. We had wandered well down the
road of FITS contortions. The limitations on FITS header keyword lengths
also limits the degree of polynomials that can be employed. 

It should be noted that there have been attempts to try to generalize the
available distortion solutions, most notably FITS WCS paper IV (since
superceeded by a different paper IV!), which has languished for decades
with no hope of acceptance.

To summarize, the FITS WCS standard is general enough to handle most
resampled imaging data, which only needs standard coordinate manipulations
and projections. For unresampled data, it is often not usable. Also, for
spectral data, it is woefully incapable of dealing with the many forms
that raw spectral data take.

Some astronomers may say that they only deal with resampled data and do not
care about the intracacies of distortions or dispersion relations for raw
data. That may be, but more and more often, modern fitting techniques prefer
to use the unresampled data (e.g., Bayesian techniques). And this is where
the FITS WCS standard often is completely inadequate.

Advantages of GWCS
..................


The `GWCS <https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs>`__ package and GWCS object is
a generalized WCS implementation that mitigates these limitations. The
capabilities that GWCS provides are:

* Arbitrary construction of transformations from simpler transformations. 
  In other words, one may combine transformations arithmetically, or feed
  the output of a transformation into another. A rich library of
  transformations, including all FITS supported projections, is provided.
* The ability to define intermediate frames of reference, and make those
  accessible. For example, slit plane coordinates.
* Associating frames of reference with standard coordinate systems, such
  as those provided by Astropy.
* Serializing all that information to the data file. A library that supports
  this serialization can compute the coordinate transformations based 
  soley on the file contents.
* Mechanisms for extending the transformations are provided, as well as 
  the ability to provide extensions for serializing such new transformations.
  Such extensions allow an instrument or telescope to produce data that
  uses their extension, where the serialization extension can be incorporated
  into ASDF without requiring a standards update (something that is currently
  quite painful to do in FITS).
* Use of Astropy frames of reference allow for further transforms to other
  standard reference frames using the mechanisms that Astropy provides.
* The transforms support the use of coordinate units based on the Astropy
  unit framework, allowing easy conversion of world coordinates,
  particularly for spectral and time coordinates.

Is the rest of this needed?
===========================
The goal of
the GWCS package is to provide a flexible toolkit for expressing and evaluating
transformations between pixel and world coordinates, as well as intermediate
frames along the course of this transformation.The GWCS object supports a data
model which includes the entire transformation pipeline from input pixel
coordinates to world coordinates (and vice versa). The basis of the GWCS object
is astropy `modeling <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/modeling/>`__. Models
that describe the pixel ⟷ world transformations can be chained, joined or
combined with arithmetic operators using the flexible framework of compound
models in modeling. This approach allows for easy access to intermediate
frames. In the case of a celestial output frame `coordinates
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/>`__ provides further
transformations between standard celestial coordinate frames. Spectral output
coordinates are instances of `~astropy.units.Quantity` and can be transformed
to other units with the tools in that package. `~astropy.time.Time` coordinates
are instances of `~astropy.time.Time`. GWCS supports transforms initialized
with `~astropy.units.Quantity` objects ensuring automatic unit conversion.
