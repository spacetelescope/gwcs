  or `~astropy.units.Quantity` object. This is triggered by a new
  parameter to the ``__call__`` method, ``output`` which takes values
  of "numericals" (default) or "numericals_plus".    [#64]

API_Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added ``atol`` argument to ``LabelMapperDict``, representing the absolute tolerance [#29]
